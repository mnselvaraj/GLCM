# GLCM
GLCM represtation application using javascript.

Multidimensional arrays are used to store the matrix values. 

The input matrix values are looped through using for statement and respective valid pair
values are identified for the given distance and angle. Then these values are used as coordinates to identify the
relevant cell in the GLCM matrix. All the possible combinations are pushed into an array along with the coordinates
of the input matrix pair positions.
